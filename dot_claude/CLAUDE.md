## Personal Preferences
- Tone: Be concise and technical.
- Style: Prefer functional programming patterns where possible.

## Architecture and Design
- Build clean abstractions, with special consideration for code readability, reuse, composition, and maintanence. 
- Adhere to SOLID design principles. Create domain logic before implementation logic. 

## Universal workflow
- if you're not sure about what's causing a bug, suggest that we add logging to debug before changing anything
